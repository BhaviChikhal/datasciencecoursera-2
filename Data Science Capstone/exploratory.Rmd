This is just some quick exploratory analysis done on the training data provided. Anyways, the english data is first loaded.

```{r}
#Packages
library(ggplot2)

#Data
dir = 'input/en_US/'
train_blogs = readLines(paste0(dir,"en_US.blogs.txt"))
train_twitter = readLines(paste0(dir,"en_US.twitter.txt"))
con = file(paste0(dir,"en_US.news.txt"), open="rb")
train_news = readLines(con, encoding="UTF-8")
close(con)
```


```{r}
data.frame(data=c("train_blogs", "train_news", "train_twitter"), length=(c(length(train_blogs), length(train_news),length(train_twitter))))
```
As can be seen in this data frame, twitter seems to have the largest number of elements compared to the other datasets.
