#Proving the Central Limit Theorem

Overview

This report will show off a model which will predict the manner in which a person lifted barbells using accelerometer data from indiviauls working out

##Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

train = read.csv('pml-training.csv')
test = read.csv('pml-testing.csv')
```


The goal of the model is to be able to predict which of the classes that a person's method of lifting barbells correspond to. As can be seen in the table below, there are five classes with the majority of methodology falling under category A.

```{r}
table(train$classe)

```



##Sample Means vs Theoretial Mean

```{r, echo=FALSE}


```
