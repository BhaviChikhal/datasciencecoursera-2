##Overview

The data from mtcars will be looked at and analyzed to determine the relationship between the miles per gallon and whether or not the cars are automatic or manual.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

auto = subset(mtcars, mtcars$am == 0)
man = subset(mtcars, mtcars$am == 1)

mtcars
```

##Exploratory Analysis

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=am, y=mpg)) + geom_point() + labs(title='Transmission vs MPG', x='Transmission(Auto=0, Man = 1)')

```

As can be seen in the figure above, manual cars appear to have a higher maximum mpg and minimum mpg. The range in mpg widely varies amongst  manual cars compared to automatic.

##Regression modeling
```{r, echo=FALSE}

```
